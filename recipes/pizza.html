        <!--Quick introduction to the recipe-->
        <h2>Heres the deal!</h2>
        <p>My kids love pizza, so pepperoni pizza is usually a surefire dinner win. But if I'm being honest, 
            I rarely make pizza for my kids. I view pizza as a cheat night for me, and I get delivery.</p>
        
        <p>So when I decided to make pizza at home, I knew it needed to be better than your average delivery. 
            It needed tons of pepperoni, a nice crust, great flavor, and maybe even a surprise or two to 
            put it over the top.</p>

        <!--List of Ingredients-->
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>16 ounces pizza dough, store-bought or homemade</li>
            <li>1/2 cup pizza sauce</li>
            <li>18 to 20 slices pepperoni</li>
            <li>12 ounces mozzarella cheese, grated</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon fresh oregano, optional</li>
            <li>Flour for rolling and shaping dough</li>
        </ul>

        <!--List of steps-->
        <h2>Step-By-Step</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Preheat the oven to 500°F:</strong>,If you are using a pizza stone, preheat it in the 
                oven for at least 20 minutes so it is nice and hot as well.</li>
            <li><strong>Make the sauce:</strong>If you are using my sauce recipe, stir together the ingredients. 
                The sauce recipe makes just enough for one large pizza. You can easily double it if you are 
                making more than one pizza.</li>
            <li><strong>Roll out the dough:</strong>Roll out dough on a lightly floured surface. If it's hard to 
                roll, let it rest for 5 minutes so it can come to room temperature. For a large pizza, I like to 
                roll my dough into about a 14-inch diameter circle.</li>
            <li><strong>Add the toppings:</strong>Transfer the dough to a lightly dusted pizza peel. Alternatively, 
                fit it into a large cast-iron.Add sauce in a light layer all over the pizza, leaving about 1/4-inch 
                crust around the edges. Chop half of the pepperoni and sprinkle it over the sauce. Top the pizza with 
                grated cheese and the rest of the pepperoni. Season with black pepper.</li>
            <li><strong>Cook the pizza:</strong>If you're using a pizza stone, carefully slide pizza into the 
                center of the preheated pizza stone. Cook for 6 minutes, then rotate the pizza halfway so it 
                cooks evenly. Cook for another 6 to 8 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and charred 
                in spots.<em> If you're using a skillet,</em>press the dough into a cast iron skillet and add 
                toppings. Place the skillet over a high heat burner for 2 minutes to get it preheated and get 
                the crust cooking right away. Then transfer to a 500 °F oven and bake for 10 to 12 minutes, or 
                until the crust is golden brown.</li>
            <li><strong>Slice and serve:</strong>Use pizza peel to slide pizza out onto a cutting board. Let the 
                pizza rest for a minute and slice into pieces. Season with fresh oregano (optional). Serve while 
                warm with a side salad.</li>
