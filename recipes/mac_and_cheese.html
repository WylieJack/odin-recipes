        <!-- Quick introduction-->
        <h2>Heres the big cheese!</h2>
        <p>I'm pretty sure that most adults love a great homemade macaroni and cheese recipe just as much as our 
            kids do! My kids will enjoy a box of Kraft macaroni and day, but everyone gets especially excited 
            when I make this homemade mac and cheese, and for good reason!</p>
        
        <!-- List of ingredients-->
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 lb uncooked elbow macaroni , about 1 ½ cups</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>2 Tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups milk , any kind</li>
            <li>3/4 cup half and half</li>
            <li>2 1/2 cups shredded cheddar cheese</li>
        </ul>

        <!--Step by step instructions-->
        <h2>Step-By-Step</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Preheat the oven: </strong>to 325 degrees F and lightly grease an 8' square (or similar size) baking dish.</li>
            <li><strong>Cook the macaroni: </strong>to al dente, according to package instructions. Drain and set aside.</li>
            <li><strong>Make the sauce: </strong>Melt the butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Blend in the flour, salt, and pepper. 
                Cook for 2 minutes. Slowly add the milk and half and half, stirring constantly, and cook over medium-low heat for a 
                few minutes until the mixture has thickened like the consistency of gravy, about 5-7 minutes. Remove from heat and stir 
                in 1 cup shredded cheese, stirring just until melted.</li>
            <li><strong>Combine: </strong>Add the cooked macaroni noodles and toss to coat. Pour half or the pasta mixture into the 
                prepared baking dish. Sprinkle ½ cup cheese over the top. Add remaining pasta and sprinkle with remaining cheese.</li>
            <li><strong>Bake: </strong> for 15-20 minutes or until cheese is melted on top.</li>
        </ol>
